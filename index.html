    <h2>Birthday message</h2>
    <p>
      To Khushdeep, I'm glad you've finally turned 21. You have come so far as a person since the time I've met you, and more than that, I am glad to met you and also thank you bhagwaan ji for sending khushu into my life. You are incredibly loyal, sticking through hard times, and good at doing nakhraas cause i love those from you. I hope you are enjoying your dating phase with me, and I cannot wait to go on a vaccation with you. Keep doing what you're doing; everyone loves you. Also sorry im so bad at writing genuine heartfelt messages and you know me so id rather keep it short.
        Love from Shrey.
    </p>
